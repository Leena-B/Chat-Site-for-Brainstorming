# Chat-Site-for-Brainstorming

This chat site is designed for collaborative brainstorming for younger audiences. The site utilizes the JavaScript Socket.io library and Node.js to enable real-time communication for users. As users enter and log their chats on the left side of the screen, a balloon containing the text of their chat floats to the top of the screen -- a visualization of the user's idea. 

I created this project in Summer 2020 after being inspired by the middle school students I was teaching at StreetCode Academy in Menlo Park. We frequently used the Zoom chat or resources like Jamboard for collaborative brainstorming. I wanted to create something similar with the added visual effect of balloons.

To run the website with local hosting, use the command "npx nodemon index.js"
